# Expanded Snake

This was the final project of my A2 coursework. It's an iteration of the original 'Snake' game which is based around collecting food to grow the length of you character while avoiding collision. The aim of the game is to collect as much food as possible before inevitably colliding with either yourself or the barriers around the map.

This version of the game features the ability to play against another player locally, or to play versus AI. This adds additional playability to the game through a real-time competitive aspect.

## Installation
